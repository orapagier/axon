# Axon 🧠

> A highly autonomous, multi-platform AI agent written entirely in **async Rust** (`tokio`) with a **Vue 3** dashboard. It answers and acts across your messaging channels, runs real tools, routes LLM requests across many providers with automatic fallback, and remembers context via SQLite + Qdrant.

Axon is a single self-contained process that acts as the operating intelligence for your digital life. It bridges raw LLM power and real-world action: reading and replying to messages, executing shell commands and SSH, calling Gmail/Calendar/Drive/Outlook/Instagram/CRM, running scheduled jobs, watching sources for changes, and chaining those steps together in visual workflows — all behind a live web dashboard.

## 🌟 Highlights

- **One process.** The agent, the dashboard, the webhooks, the scheduler, and **all** integration tools (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Instagram, CRM) run in-process — no separate server, no SSE hop.
- **Multi-channel.** Telegram, Discord, Slack, Facebook/Messenger, WhatsApp, and a built-in web chat — all out of the box.
- **Resilient model router.** Priority tiers, sticky routing, round-robin within a tier, automatic 429-quarantine with cooldown, and a last-resort `paid_model` fallback. Requests don't drop.
- **Deep, layered memory.** Short-term SQLite history per session, long-term Qdrant vector recall (always presented as *hints to verify with tools*, never ground truth), and compressed searchable tool observations.
- **Real tools.** Shell, SSH, HTTP, web search, image generation/processing, parallel workers, cron jobs, watchers, and workflows.
- **Self-correcting.** A validation pipeline (claim guard, refusal nudge, blank/raw-syntax guards, and an optional secondary-LLM quality check) catches hallucinations and tool misuse before anything is sent publicly.
- **Live dashboard.** Mobile-friendly Vue 3 UI for chat, models, tools, services, memory, files, tasks, watchers, and the visual workflow canvas — all changeable live without a restart.
- **Secure by design.** Bearer master-key auth, AES-256-GCM encryption of all secrets at rest, shell blocklist, path-traversal protection, and HMAC-verified webhooks.

```

The agent is the only process users talk to. It owns the dashboard, webhooks, the reasoning loop, **and** the integration tools themselves (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, OneDrive, Outlook, Facebook pages, Instagram, CRM, etc.), which run in-process. Axon can still connect to **external** MCP servers you add from the dashboard's Services/MCP page (those continue to use SSE). **Qdrant** is the only external dependency, used for long-term semantic memory.

---

## 📦 Repository Layout

| Path | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `Cargo.toml` | **Cargo workspace root** — ties every Rust crate under `crates/` into one build (a single `target/` and `Cargo.lock`). Shared build profiles live here. |
| `crates/axon-agent/` | **The core agent + web dashboard** (Rust, package `axon`). The main binary you run: HTTP API, dashboard UI, WebSocket stream, webhooks, scheduler, watcher, workflows, and the agent reasoning loop. |
| `crates/axon-core/` | Shared types, OAuth token store, credentials handling used by the integration crates. |
| `crates/axon-google/` · `axon-microsoft/` · `axon-facebook/` · `axon-instagram/` · `axon-business/` · `axon-crm/` | **Integration tool crates** compiled **directly into `axon-agent`** as path dependencies (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Instagram, CRM, and business/utility tools). |
| `crates/axon-image/` | Image-processing/generation library (`image_processor`) used by the agent's `image_tool`. |
| `axon-ui/` | **Web dashboard** (Vue 3 + Vite + Vue Flow). Built to static files and served by `axon-agent`. |
| `qdrant/` | Deployment scripts for the Qdrant vector DB (systemd units, backup/health/trim timers, collection setup). |
| `deployaxongcp.sh`, `deploycham*.sh`, `deployfrontend.sh` | Production build + deploy scripts (build release binaries, bundle, ship to the server). |
| `run.bat` | One-click local Windows build-and-run (builds UI, copies static, runs the agent). |
| `crates/axon-agent/config/models.toml` | **Model catalog** — the source of truth for which LLMs Axon can use. |
| `crates/axon-agent/memory/schema.sql` | SQLite schema applied on startup. |
| `USER_GUIDE.md` | The deep operator manual (everything in this README and more, in narrative form). |

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

- **Rust toolchain** 1.70+ (a current stable toolchain; `cargo`).
- **Node.js 18+** and npm (only needed to build the dashboard UI).
- **SQLite3** — bundled via the Rust crate; no separate install required for the agent.
- **Qdrant** — a running instance for long-term memory. Optional for a first run (the agent starts fine without it; semantic recall is simply disabled), but required for the full memory feature. See [`qdrant/README.md`](./qdrant/README.md) and `qdrant/install.sh`.
- API keys for at least one LLM provider (see [Configuration](#️-configuration)).

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

The fastest path on Windows:

```bat
run.bat
```

`run.bat` will:

1. `npm install` (if needed) and `npm run build` inside `axon-ui/`.
2. Copy `axon-ui/dist/*` into `crates/axon-agent/static/`.
3. Stop any running `axon` process, then `cargo run` the agent.

Manual equivalent (any OS):

```bash
# 1) Build the dashboard
cd axon-ui
npm install
npm run build

# 2) Make the built UI available to the agent
#    (the agent serves ./static as the dashboard)
mkdir -p ../crates/axon-agent/static
cp -r dist/* ../crates/axon-agent/static/

# 3) Run the agent
cd ../crates/axon-agent
cargo run            # or: cargo run --release   (run from anywhere in the workspace)
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000**.

> The agent serves the UI from `crates/axon-agent/static/`. If you change UI code, rebuild the UI and re-copy `dist/` into `static/` — this is exactly what `run.bat` automates.

The Google/Microsoft/Facebook/Instagram/CRM tools are built into the agent and start automatically — **no second process to run.** OAuth happens from the dashboard's **Services** page; the callback returns to the agent itself (`/auth/:service/callback`).

> For OAuth redirects and Instagram media URLs to resolve correctly, set `AXON_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` (or `AXON_CALLBACK_HOST`) to the agent's public base URL — or set `instagram.public_base_url` on the Settings page. `credentials.json` (your OAuth app client IDs/secrets) must sit in the agent's working directory or its local data directory.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Axon reads configuration from three layers, in increasing precedence:

1. **`config/models.toml`** — the model catalog (source of truth for models).
2. **Environment variables / `.env`** — secrets and process-level settings.
3. **The dashboard settings + database** — runtime settings changeable live without a restart.

### Environment variables

Loaded automatically from (in order) `$AXON_ENV_FILE`, the working-directory `.env`, and `.env`/`axon-agent.env` next to the executable.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `AXON_PORT` | `3000` | Dashboard / API / webhook listen port. |
| `AXON_DB_PATH` | `memory/axon.db` | SQLite database path. |
| `AXON_MASTER_KEY` | *(unset)* | **Dashboard auth + secret-encryption key.** See [Security](#-security). |
| `AXON_ENV_FILE` | *(unset)* | Explicit path to an env file to load first. |
| `AXON_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` / `AXON_CALLBACK_HOST` | *(unset)* | Public base URL for OAuth redirects & Instagram media. |
| `QDRANT_URL` | *(provider default)* | Qdrant endpoint for long-term memory. |
| `VOYAGE_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | Embedding key used by the memory store. |
| `TELOXIDE_TOKEN` | *(unset)* | Telegram bot token (or `messaging.telegram_token` in settings). |
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | *(unset)* | Discord bot token (or `messaging.discord_token`). |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | *(unset)* | Slack bot token (or `messaging.slack_token`). |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | *(unset)* | If set, enables OpenTelemetry tracing export. |
| `RUST_LOG` | `axon=info` | Standard `tracing` log filter. |
| *(provider keys)* | — | Referenced from `models.toml` as `${NAME}` placeholders, e.g. `GEMINI_API_KEY_*`, `GROQ_*`, `CEREBRAS_*`. |

### The model catalog — `config/models.toml`

On every startup, Axon **syncs `models.toml` into the database as the source of truth**: models in the file are upserted, and any model in the DB that is *not* in the file is deleted. Edit the TOML, restart, and the dashboard reflects it.

Each `[[models]]` entry:

```toml
[[models]]
name        = "gemini-flash"          # unique display name
provider    = "google"                # google | anthropic | groq | cerebras |
                                       # openai/openai_compat | ollama | nvidia | openrouter
model_id    = "gemini-2.5-flash"      # provider model id. Comma-separated = per-model fallback
api_key     = "${GEMINI_API_KEY}"     # literal key, or ${ENV_OR_SETTING} placeholder
base_url    = "https://..."           # optional; required for OpenAI-compatible providers
role        = ""                      # "" = general pool. See roles below
priority    = 1                       # lower number = higher priority tier
timeout_secs = 60                     # optional per-model call timeout
max_tokens  = 4096                    # optional (defaults to 4096)
enabled     = true                    # optional (defaults to true)
```

**Roles** route specific kinds of work to specific models:

| Role | Used for |
|------|---------|
| `""` (empty) | General pool — the default for normal requests. |
| `simple_tasks` | Fast/cheap model for conversational, no-tool, first-attempt replies. |
| `complex_tasks` | Most capable model for tool use, corrections, and long runs. |
| `router` | Small model used to convert natural-language schedules to cron, etc. |
| `quality_checker` | Secondary model that audits the main agent's output. |
| `axon_node` | Model used by the "Axon" node inside Workflows. |
| `paid_model` | **Last-resort** fallback, only tried after every free option is exhausted. |

**`model_id` fallback chains:** a comma-separated `model_id` (e.g. `"gpt-oss-120b,gpt-oss-20b"`) lets one entry try several upstream model IDs in order before the record is considered failed.

### Runtime settings (dashboard / DB)

Most behavior is tunable live via the **Settings** page (stored in the `settings` table). Notable keys and their defaults:

- `agent.max_iterations` (`20`), `agent.max_parallel_tools` (`5`), `agent.tool_timeout_secs` (`30`)
- `agent.run_timeout_secs` (`300`) — total wall-clock budget for one run; the model-failover chain is bounded only by this.
- `agent.quality_check` (`true`), `agent.allow_tool_writing` (`true`)
- `agent.system_prompt` — the master system prompt (editable live).
- `router.error_threshold` (`2`, consecutive errors before a model is parked until midnight), `router.model_call_timeout_secs` (`30`, flat per-attempt timeout; overridable per model).
- `memory.short_term_max_msgs` (`50`), `memory.long_term_top_k` (`5`).
- `websearch.enabled`, `websearch.max_results`.
- `watcher.user_name`, `watcher.user_title`, `watcher.quiet_hours_*`.
- `scheduler.nudge_prompt` — template for scheduled reminders.
- `instagram.*` — public base URL, bind address, and media-poll timeouts for IG publishing.

## 🧠 The Agent Reasoning Loop

What happens on each request:

1. **Context build** — loads short-term history for the session, searches long-term memory and recent tool observations (skipped for pure greetings), and routes an initial tool set.
2. **Iterate** (bounded by `agent.max_iterations` and `agent.run_timeout_secs`):
   - Pick a model by role/priority (see [Model Router](#-the-model-router)), with **sticky routing** (stays on the model that worked last turn to avoid tool-format drift).
   - Call the LLM with the filtered tool set and a flat per-attempt timeout.
   - If the model emits tool calls, execute them (up to `agent.max_parallel_tools` in parallel) and feed results back.
   - If the model answers, run the **validation pipeline**.
3. **Validation pipeline** (cheapest checks first):
   - *Claim guard* — blocks "I sent/created/deleted…" claims that have no matching successful tool-execution receipt.
   - *Refusal nudge* — if a tool was available but the model said "I can't", it's nudged to actually use the tool.
   - *Blank-response* and *raw-tool-syntax* guards.
   - *Quality check* — an optional secondary LLM (`quality_checker` role) audits tool-backed answers and can request a revision (up to 3 times).
4. **Finalize** — strips reasoning/markdown noise, resolves `<send_file>…</send_file>` tags into downloads/attachments, persists the run, and streams the answer.

---

## 🔀 The Model Router

- **Priority tiers:** models are grouped by `priority` (lower = higher). Within a tier the pick is a fair round-robin / pseudo-random rotation across distinct provider/model endpoints — no rate-limit-headroom steering; a model is only ever skipped when it's actually unavailable.
- **Fallback order per request:** preferred model (if the caller picked one) → sticky model → role pool → general pool → a sweep over any remaining free model → `paid_model` last. Failover is **immediate** — on an error, 429, or per-attempt timeout the router moves straight to the next available model with no wait.
- **Rate-limit quarantine:** a `429`/quota error parks the model for a window-based cooldown and routing falls through to the next option without dropping the request. An explicit provider reset always wins when given (a `Retry-After` header, Gemini's `retryDelay`, or an inline "try again in …"); otherwise a flat default per window:
  - *per-minute* limit → 60 s,
  - *per-hour* limit → 60 min,
  - *daily* quota exhausted → until the window resets (provider reset if given, else next UTC midnight).

  A non-rate-limit error parks the model until midnight after `router.error_threshold` consecutive failures. A successful call reinstates the model immediately; cooldowns otherwise auto-expire.
- **Flat per-attempt timeout:** each call gets `router.model_call_timeout_secs` (default 30 s, overridable per model), bounded only by the overall run deadline — no adaptive/fair-share math.
- **Alerts:** rate-limit, timeout, and "paid fallback used" events are collected per run and surfaced to the operator (dashboard + messaging notifications).

Supported providers: **Google Gemini, Anthropic, Groq, Cerebras, NVIDIA, OpenRouter, OpenAI / OpenAI-compatible, Ollama.**

---

## 🗄 Memory

- **Short-term (SQLite):** the last N messages per `session_id`/`chat_id` (`memory.short_term_max_msgs`, default 50). Reconstructed into the prompt each run.
- **Long-term (Qdrant):** useful, tool-backed results are embedded and stored for semantic recall on future requests (`memory.long_term_top_k` results injected as *hints*). Requires Qdrant + an embedding key (`VOYAGE_API_KEY`).
- **Tool observations:** large tool outputs are compressed and stored, searchable via SQLite FTS, and recent ones are surfaced as context.

Memories are always presented to the model as **hints to verify with tools**, never as ground truth — this is enforced in the system prompt and the claim guard.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Integrations

### Built-in tools (in `axon-agent`)

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `shell_tool` | Runs `bash -c <cmd>` with a per-call timeout and streamed output. A blocklist rejects catastrophic commands (`rm -rf /`, `mkfs`, `dd if=`, `chmod -R`, `iptables`, `ufw`, `passwd`, `userdel`, …). |
| `ssh_tool` | Run commands / transfer files on remote servers configured on the SSH page; credentials encrypted at rest. |
| `http_request` | Arbitrary HTTP requests plus a library of saved HTTP requests. |
| `web_search` | Web search with quota-rotating accounts. |
| `image_tool` | Image generation/processing via the bundled `image_processor` crate. |
| `parallel_worker` | Fan out sub-tasks in parallel. |
| `cron_job_tool` | Create scheduled jobs from the agent. |
| `watcher_tool` | Create watchers from the agent. |
| `run_workflow` | Trigger a workflow from the agent. |

When `agent.allow_tool_writing` is on, the agent can also **write a temporary tool on the fly** for a one-off need.

### Built-in integrations (in-process, from the `crates/axon-*` crates)

- **Google** — Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Contacts, Tasks, Meet, Chat, Forms, Places, YouTube.
- **Microsoft** — Outlook, Calendar, OneDrive, Teams.
- **Facebook** — Pages, posts, comments, insights, messaging.
- **Instagram** — Publishing.
- **CRM** — Leads, deals, organizations, activities.
- **Business utilities** — Notes, tasks, datetime, text, web.

Connect the integrations from the dashboard's **Services** page (OAuth for Google/Microsoft/Facebook). Tokens persist in the DB across rebuilds. External MCP servers can also be added from the **Services → MCP** page (those run over SSE).

---

## 💬 Messaging Channels

Set the relevant token (env var or `messaging.*` setting) and restart:

| Channel | Env / Setting | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| **Telegram** | `TELOXIDE_TOKEN` / `messaging.telegram_token` | Long-polling starts automatically; replies route back to the originating workflow. |
| **Discord** | `DISCORD_TOKEN` / `messaging.discord_token` | Gateway connection. |
| **Slack** | `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` / `messaging.slack_token` | Point your Slack app's Events URL at `POST /api/slack/events`. |
| **Facebook / Messenger** | `credentials.json` (app secret, verify token, page id) | Webhook: `GET/POST /webhook/facebook`. Comment auto-replies queued with human-like delays and a "Like" before replying. |
| **WhatsApp** | — | Webhook: `GET/POST /webhook/whatsapp`. |
| **Web chat** | — | Built into the dashboard (Chat page + live WebSocket). |

---

## ⏰ Scheduler, Watchers & Workflows

- **Scheduler** (Tasks page): natural-language or 6-field cron schedules ("every 5 minutes", "daily at 9am", "every Monday at 9am"). NL is converted to cron via the `router` model. Fired jobs run as agent tasks and can send reminders using `scheduler.nudge_prompt`.
- **Watchers** (Watchers page): poll a source (e.g. an email inbox, a shell command's output) and notify the owner when something new/changed appears, with quiet-hours support.
- **Workflows** (Workflows page): a visual DAG of nodes (Trigger, Shell, JS, Synapse/Axon agent node, IF, Switch) with edges, built on [Vue Flow](https://vueflow.dev/). Triggerable manually, on a schedule, or via `POST /webhook/external/:workflow_id`. On completion, a workflow can hand its output to the agent for post-processing.

---

## 🔒 Security

- **Dashboard auth:** every `/api/*` route and the `/ws` WebSocket require the master key.
  - REST clients send `Authorization: Bearer <AXON_MASTER_KEY>`.
  - The browser WebSocket sends it as a (URL-encoded) `?api_key=` query parameter.
  - **If `AXON_MASTER_KEY` is unset, auth is disabled entirely** (open dashboard). This is intended only for local dev — **always set a strong `AXON_MASTER_KEY` in production.**
- **Secret encryption:** API keys, SSH credentials, and MCP keys are encrypted with **AES-256-GCM** (key derived from `AXON_MASTER_KEY`) before being written to SQLite.
  - ⚠️ If `AXON_MASTER_KEY` is unset, encryption falls back to an insecure all-zeros key (and logs a warning). Changing the master key after secrets are stored makes existing secrets undecryptable — set it once, up front.
- **File downloads** are restricted to the staging directory (`data/files`) via canonical-path validation, preventing path traversal.
- **Webhook authenticity:** Facebook events are verified with HMAC-SHA256 against the app secret; the verify token gates subscription.
- **Shell blocklist scope (be aware):** the shell guardrail blocks the catastrophic patterns listed above but, by design, still permits *scoped* destructive commands (e.g. `rm -rf ./build`). Treat the agent's shell access as you would a trusted operator account; do not expose the dashboard publicly without a master key, and run it as a least-privilege user.

A Vue 3 + Vite SPA built into static files and served by the agent. Pages include:

- **Chat** — talk to the agent live, watch the reasoning stream.
- **Models** — manage the model catalog (add/edit/prioritize/enable/reset) live.
- **Tools** — inspect and toggle built-in and MCP tools.
- **Services** — OAuth connect/disconnect for Google/Microsoft/Facebook, MCP servers, credentials, SSH servers, web-search accounts.
- **Memory** — browse, search, and delete memories.
- **Files** — staged file uploads/downloads.
- **Tasks** — scheduled jobs (cron / natural language).
- **Watchers** — source pollers with quiet hours.
- **Workflows** — visual DAG canvas (Vue Flow) with run history.
- **Settings** — every runtime knob, including the live system prompt.
- **Docs** — in-app documentation.

To rebuild the dashboard after UI changes:

```bash
cd axon-ui && npm run build && cp -r dist/* ../crates/axon-agent/static/
```

## 📦 Production Deployment

The deploy scripts build the release `axon` binary (with the integration crates compiled in), build the UI, bundle everything into `axon_deploy.tar.gz`, and ship it to the configured server.

```bash
bash deployaxongcp.sh                # full build + bundle + deploy (GCP target)
bash deployaxongcp.sh --clean        # cargo clean first (full rebuild)
bash deployaxongcp.sh --skip-build   # deploy the existing tar.gz
bash deployaxongcp.sh --skip-deploy  # build + bundle only
```

Variants: `deploycham.sh` / `deploychamgcp.sh` / `deploycham-wipe.sh` / `deployaxon-wipe.sh` / `deployfrontend.sh` (frontend-only).

> **Update `TARGET_SERVER`/`GCP_INSTANCE`/`REMOTE_DIR` and SSH details at the top of each script** to your own host before using them. All integration services run in-process with the agent.

On the server:

- Run the agent under a process supervisor (**systemd**).
- Install Qdrant via `qdrant/install.sh` (also sets up backup/health/trim timers and the systemd unit).
- Set a strong `AXON_MASTER_KEY` and keep it stable (it encrypts stored secrets).

## 🧰 Development

This is a standard Cargo workspace. Useful commands:

```bash
# Build everything (debug)
cargo build

# Build the release binary (LTO + stripped)
cargo build --release

# Run the agent (from the workspace root)
cargo run -p axon

# Check a single crate without producing artifacts
cargo check -p axon-google

# Watch UI in dev mode with hot reload
cd axon-ui && npm run dev
```

Build profiles (defined at the workspace root):

- `[profile.dev]` — `debug = 0`, `codegen-units = 1`, incremental off (faster full builds).
- `[profile.release]` — `opt-level = 3`, `lto = true`, `codegen-units = 1`, `strip = true`.

Set `RUST_LOG=axon=debug` for verbose tracing during development.

## 🩹 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---------|--------------------|
| Dashboard loads but every API call 401s | Wrong/missing master key in the browser. Log in again; confirm `AXON_MASTER_KEY` matches. |
| REST works but the live log/chat stream never connects | WebSocket auth — ensure the `api_key` query param matches and is URL-safe. |
| "All models exhausted — check API keys or wait for rate limits to reset" | No usable model. Check that provider keys resolve (`${...}` placeholders must exist in env or settings), that models are `enabled`, and whether everything is on rate-limit cooldown. |
| `Model '…' has unresolved API key placeholder ${X}` | The `${X}` in `models.toml` isn't defined in the environment or the `settings` table. Add it to `.env` or the Settings page. |
| Integration tools (Gmail/Calendar/etc.) missing | The in-process integrations failed to initialize — usually a missing `credentials.json`. Check the startup log for "In-process MCP init failed". |
| Decryption warnings / garbled stored keys | `AXON_MASTER_KEY` changed (or was unset) after secrets were saved. Re-enter the affected secrets with the correct, stable key. |
| Long-term memory recall does nothing | Qdrant not running or `VOYAGE_API_KEY` unset. The agent runs fine without it, but semantic recall is disabled. |
| `npm run build` fails with `'vite' is not recognized` | UI dev dependencies aren't installed. Run `npm install` in `axon-ui/` first. |
| Stuck `running` runs after a crash | Cleaned up automatically on the next startup (marked `failed`). |

Logs: set `RUST_LOG=axon=debug` for verbose tracing. Facebook auto-reply has an extra debug log at `/tmp/autoreply_debug.log` on the server.
